# JUMPlus-Project-4

The final implementation of the original [JUMPlus-Project-1](https://github.com/ajnorthouse/JUMPlus-Project-1).

> "The project goal was to create a mock console application that a user could use to access a database (either external or in memory) to interact with their banking account. The main goals with this was to implement a MVC architecture, testing, and have the console print statements in color."

This time however, the goal is to create a RESTful API using Spring Boot with some form of DB persistence, along with a Single Page UI using React or Angular. There were also optional goals to integrate microservices and to actually deploy the project.

## Technologies used:

- Java 16
  - Spring Boot
  - Spring Web
  - Spring Security
  - Spring Data JPA
  - MySQL Connector
  - Swagger
- JavaScript
  - React
- MySQL Database

## Objectives:

1. Use Spring Boot to create a RESTful Service Backend with Data persistence (may choose DB)
1. SPA Front End (React or Angular)

## Optional:

1. Integrate microservices or create own microservices and use Service Architecture.
1. External Deployment.
   - the easiest, free, resource is Heroku, however AWS will help with relevant job skills.
